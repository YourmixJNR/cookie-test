# Cookie Persistence Testing in Next.js Production Environment

## Overview

Exploring and troubleshooting the behavior of cookies in a Next.js application when deployed in a production setting. I've noticed that cookies set from an external API do not persist in the browser under production conditions, unlike in the development environment.

## Objective

My primary goal is to uncover and rectify the underlying issue that prevents cookie persistence in the production phase of a Next.js application. Ensuring consistent cookie handling across different deployment stages is crucial for the functionality of web applications.

## Current Issue

The core challenge I'm facing involves cookies not being saved or stored in the browser when the application operates in the production environment. This behavior contrasts sharply with the development environment, where cookies function as intended.

## Seeking Community Help
